/// Registry for ``PathObject`` subscriptions and path-event dispatch. One per ``RealtimeObject``

/// `DefaultRealtimeObject.pathObjectSubscriptionRegister` and its `PathObjectSubscriptionRegister`.
///
/// ## Concurrency (plan §1.1)
///
/// The register is **queue-confined**: every entry point (`nosync_subscribe`, `nosync_unsubscribe`,
/// `nosync_notifyPathEvent`, `nosync_dispose`) runs on the objects engine's internal serial queue,
/// enforced by `dispatchPrecondition`. Subscriptions are registered from public callers via a hop
/// onto that queue (see ``DefaultPathObject/subscribe(options:listener:)``); dispatch already runs on
/// it (path notification happens inside the inbound-message apply path). There is **no lock**: the
/// mutable `subscriptions` map is plain queue-confined state.
///
/// Listener callbacks are emitted on `userCallbackQueue` (never under any mutex — the issue #120
/// convention), matching ``SubscriptionStorage``'s off-lock `async` dispatch.
///
/// ## Why not ``SubscriptionStorage``
///
/// `SubscriptionStorage` broadcasts the *same* update to every subscriber of an event name. Path
/// dispatch is per-subscription: each registration resolves its *own* covered path from the
/// candidate list (RTO24b2b, depth-windowed coverage RTO24c1), so a uniform broadcast cannot express
/// it. This mirrors Kotlin, which likewise subclasses `EventEmitter` with a per-listener `apply`
/// rather than reusing the LiveMap/LiveCounter change coordinators verbatim. (Deviation candidate.)
///
/// Spec: `RTO24`, `RTO24a`, `RTPO19`.
