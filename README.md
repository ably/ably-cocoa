### Swift Package Manager

The Ably Pub/Sub SDK includes installation support for [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/).

<details>
<summary>Swift Package Manager installation details.</summary>

To install the `ably-cocoa` package in your Xcode project: 

* Paste `https://github.com/ably/ably-cocoa` in the *Swift Packages* search box. ( *Xcode project*  &rarr;  *Swift Packages..* . &rarr; `+` button)
* Select the `Ably` SDK for your target.

To install the `ably-cocoa` package in another Swift package, add the following to your `Package.Swift`:

```swift
 .package(url: "https://github.com/ably/ably-cocoa", from: "1.2.45"),
```

See Apple's [adding package dependencies to your app](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift_packages/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app) guide for more detail.
</details>

### CocoaPods

The Ably Pub/Sub SDK includes installation support for [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/).

<details>
<summary>CocoaPods installation details.</summary>

If you intend to use Swift, using `use_frameworks!` in your Podfile is recommended (this will create a Framework that can be used in Swift natively).

Add this line to your application's Podfile:

```ruby
# For Xcode 7.3 and newer
pod 'Ably', '>= 1.2'
```

And then install the dependency:

```bash
$ pod install
```

</details>



### Carthage

The Ably Pub/Sub SDK includes installation support for [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/).

<details>
<summary>Carthage installation details.</summary>

Add the following line to your application's Cartfile:

```ruby
# For Xcode 7.3 and newer
github "ably/ably-cocoa" >= 1.2
```

And then run one of the following commands required for your platform:

| Platform | Command |
|----------|---------|
| iOS | `carthage update --use-xcframeworks --platform iOS --no-use-binaries` |
| macOS | `carthage update --use-xcframeworks --platform macOS --no-use-binaries`|
| tvOS | `carthage update --use-xcframeworks --platform tvOS --no-use-binaries` |

After building the framework (located in `[PROJECT_ROOT]/Carthage/Build`), drag the following files into the **Frameworks**, **Libraries**, and **Embedded content** section of your Xcode target’s **General** tab:

* `Ably.xcframework`
* `AblyDeltaCodec.xcframework`
* `msgpack.xcframework`
* For applications, select **Embed & Sign**
* For other targets, select **Do Not Embed**

If you encounter an error similar to the following, you’ve likely missed adding one or more required dependencies:

```
dyld: Library not loaded: @rpath/AblyDeltaCodec.framework/AblyDeltaCodec
```

For further information review the Carthage [adding frameworks to an application](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#adding-frameworks-to-an-application) guide.

realtime.connection.on { stateChange in
    if stateChange.current == .connected {
        print("Connected to Ably")
        
        // Get a reference to the 'test-channel' channel
        let channel = realtime.channels.get("test-channel")
        
        // Subscribe to all messages published to this channel
        channel.subscribe { message in
            print("Received message: \(message.data ?? "")")
        }
        
        // Publish a test message to the channel
        channel.publish("test-event", data: "hello world!") { error in
