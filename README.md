---

## Installation

You can install Ably for iOS and macOS through [Swift package manager](#swift-package-manager), [CocoaPods](#cocoapods), [Carthage](#carthage) or [install manually](#manual-install).

To use the [Ably LiveObjects plugin](#liveobjects), see its installation notes below — it is
available via Swift Package Manager only.

### Swift Package Manager

The Ably Pub/Sub SDK includes installation support for [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/).

<details>
<summary>Swift Package Manager installation details.</summary>

To install the `ably-cocoa` package in your Xcode project: 

* Paste `https://github.com/ably/ably-cocoa` in the *Swift Packages* search box. ( *Xcode project*  &rarr;  *Swift Packages..* . &rarr; `+` button)
* Select the `Ably` SDK for your target.

To install the `ably-cocoa` package in another Swift package, add the following to your `Package.Swift`:

```swift
 .package(url: "https://github.com/ably/ably-cocoa", from: "1.3.0"),
```

See Apple's [adding package dependencies to your app](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift_packages/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app) guide for more detail.
</details>

### CocoaPods

The Ably Pub/Sub SDK includes installation support for [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/).

<details>
<summary>CocoaPods installation details.</summary>

If you intend to use Swift, using `use_frameworks!` in your Podfile is recommended (this will create a Framework that can be used in Swift natively).

Add this line to your application's Podfile:

```ruby
# For Xcode 7.3 and newer
pod 'Ably', '>= 1.2'
```

And then install the dependency:

```bash
$ pod install
```

</details>



### Carthage

The Ably Pub/Sub SDK includes installation support for [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/).

<details>
<summary>Carthage installation details.</summary>

Add the following line to your application's Cartfile:

```ruby
# For Xcode 7.3 and newer
github "ably/ably-cocoa" >= 1.2
```

And then run one of the following commands required for your platform:

| Platform | Command |
|----------|---------|
| iOS | `carthage update --use-xcframeworks --platform iOS --no-use-binaries` |
| macOS | `carthage update --use-xcframeworks --platform macOS --no-use-binaries`|
| tvOS | `carthage update --use-xcframeworks --platform tvOS --no-use-binaries` |

After building the framework (located in `[PROJECT_ROOT]/Carthage/Build`), drag the following files into the **Frameworks**, **Libraries**, and **Embedded content** section of your Xcode target's **General** tab:

* `Ably.xcframework`
* `AblyDeltaCodec.xcframework`
* `msgpack.xcframework`
* For applications, select **Embed & Sign**
* For other targets, select **Do Not Embed**

If you encounter an error similar to the following, you've likely missed adding one or more required dependencies:

```
dyld: Library not loaded: @rpath/AblyDeltaCodec.framework/AblyDeltaCodec
```

For further information review the Carthage [adding frameworks to an application](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#adding-frameworks-to-an-application) guide.

</details>

### Manual install

The Ably Pub/Sub SDK includes manual installation support.

<details>
<summary>Manual installation details.</summary>

* Download the [Ably Pub/Sub Cocoa SDK.](https://github.com/ably/ably-cocoa)
* Drag the `ably-cocoa/ably-cocoa` directory into your Xcode project as a group.

Ably depends on our [MessagePack Fork](https://github.com/ably-forks/msgpack-objective-C) 0.2.0; get it [from the releases page](https://github.com/ably-forks/msgpack-objective-C/releases/tag/0.2.0-ably-1) and link it into your project.

</details>

## Usage

```swift
// Initialize Ably Realtime client
let clientOptions = ARTClientOptions(key: "your-ably-api-key")
clientOptions.clientId = "me"
let realtime = ARTRealtime(options: clientOptions)

// Wait for connection to be established
realtime.connection.on { stateChange in
    if stateChange.current == .connected {
        print("Connected to Ably")
        
        // Get a reference to the 'test-channel' channel
        let channel = realtime.channels.get("test-channel")
        
        // Subscribe to all messages published to this channel
        channel.subscribe { message in
            print("Received message: \(message.data ?? "")")
        }
        
        // Publish a test message to the channel
        channel.publish("test-event", data: "hello world!") { error in
            guard error == nil else {
                print("Error publishing message: \(error!.message)")
                return
            }
            print("Message successfully published")
        }
    }
}
```

## LiveObjects

[Ably LiveObjects](https://ably.com/docs/liveobjects) provides realtime, collaborative data
structures that automatically synchronize state across all connected clients. Build interactive
applications with shared data that updates instantly across devices.

This repository contains the Ably LiveObjects plugin, which enables LiveObjects on top of the
core Pub/Sub SDK. See the [LiveObjects README](LiveObjects/README.md) for full details.

> [!WARNING]
> LiveObjects is currently experimental. Breaking changes to the `AblyLiveObjects` API may be
> made in minor or patch releases of ably-cocoa, without a major version bump; ably-cocoa's
> semantic versioning guarantees apply only to the `Ably` product.

If you are migrating from the standalone [ably-liveobjects-swift-plugin](https://github.com/ably/ably-liveobjects-swift-plugin)
package, see the [migration guide](LiveObjects/README.md#migrating-from-the-standalone-plugin-package).

### Install LiveObjects

The plugin is available via **Swift Package Manager only** (there is no CocoaPods or Carthage
distribution). There is no separate package or version to install: the plugin ships as a product
of this package and is versioned and released as part of ably-cocoa.

To install it in your Xcode project, add the `ably-cocoa` package [as above](#swift-package-manager)
and additionally select the `AblyLiveObjects` product for your target.

To install it in another Swift package, add the product to your target's dependencies:

```swift
.target(
    name: "MyTarget",
    dependencies: [
        .product(name: "Ably", package: "ably-cocoa"),
        .product(name: "AblyLiveObjects", package: "ably-cocoa"),
    ]
)
```

Then pass the plugin to the client via `ARTClientOptions`, and fetch channels with the
LiveObjects channel modes:

```swift
import Ably
import AblyLiveObjects

let clientOptions = ARTClientOptions(key: "your-ably-api-key")
clientOptions.plugins = [.liveObjects: AblyLiveObjects.Plugin.self]
let realtime = ARTRealtime(options: clientOptions)

// Fetch a channel, specifying the LiveObjects channel modes
let channelOptions = ARTRealtimeChannelOptions()
channelOptions.modes = [.objectPublish, .objectSubscribe]
let channel = realtime.channels.get("my-channel", options: channelOptions)

// `channel.object` is the entry point into the LiveObjects API. Attach the
// channel, then fetch the channel's root map once objects are synchronized:
let root = try await channel.object.get()
```

The plugin has higher platform requirements than the core SDK:

| Platform | Support |
|----------|---------|
| iOS      | >= 14.0 |
| macOS    | >= 11.0 |
| tvOS     | >= 14.0 |

> [!NOTE]
> Xcode 16.3 or later is required.

### LiveObjects example app

The [LiveObjects example app](LiveObjects/Example) is an interactive SwiftUI demo showcasing
LiveObjects. To run it, follow the instructions in the
[LiveObjects README](LiveObjects/README.md#example-app).
