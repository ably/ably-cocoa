# Ably LiveObjects plugin for ably-cocoa SDK

This is a work in progress plugin that enables LiveObjects functionality in the [ably-cocoa](https://github.com/ably/ably-cocoa/) SDK. It is not yet ready to be used.

## Supported Platforms

- macOS 11 and above
- iOS 14 and above
- tvOS 14 and above

## Requirements

Xcode 16.3 or later.

## Example app

This repository contains an example app, written using SwiftUI, which demonstrates how to use the SDK. The code for this app is in the [`Example`](Example) directory.

In order to allow the app to use modern SwiftUI features, it supports the following OS versions:

- macOS 14 and above
- iOS 17 and above
- tvOS 17 and above

To run the app, open the `AblyLiveObjects.xcworkspace` workspace in Xcode and run the `AblyLiveObjectsExample` target. If you wish to run it on an iOS or tvOS device, you’ll need to set up code signing.
