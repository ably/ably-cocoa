    if stateChange.current == .connected {
        print("Connected to Ably")
        
        // Get a reference to the 'test-channel' channel
        let channel = realtime.channels.get("test-channel")
        
        // Subscribe to all messages published to this channel
        channel.subscribe { message in
            print("Received message: \(message.data ?? "")")
        }
        
        // Publish a test message to the channel
        channel.publish("test-event", data: "hello world!") { error in
            guard error == nil else {
                print("Error publishing message: \(error!.message)")
                return

## LiveObjects

[Ably LiveObjects](https://ably.com/docs/liveobjects) provides realtime, collaborative data
structures that automatically synchronize state across all connected clients. This repository
contains the Ably LiveObjects plugin, which enables LiveObjects on top of the core Pub/Sub SDK.

### Install LiveObjects

The plugin is available via **Swift Package Manager**. There is no separate package or version to install: the plugin ships as a product
of this package and is versioned and released as part of ably-cocoa.

To install it in your Xcode project, add the `ably-cocoa` package [as above](#swift-package-manager)
and additionally select the `AblyLiveObjects` product for your target.

To install it in another Swift package, add the product to your target's dependencies:

```swift
.target(
    name: "MyTarget",
    dependencies: [
        .product(name: "AblyPubSubCore", package: "ably-cocoa"),
        .product(name: "AblyLiveObjects", package: "ably-cocoa"),
    ]
)
```

For usage, platform requirements, the example app and the
[migration guide](LiveObjects/README.md#migrating-from-the-standalone-plugin-package) for users
of the standalone plugin package, see the [LiveObjects README](LiveObjects/README.md). For a
comprehensive guide, check the [LiveObjects documentation](https://ably.com/docs/liveobjects),
starting with the [Swift quickstart](https://ably.com/docs/liveobjects/quickstart/swift).
