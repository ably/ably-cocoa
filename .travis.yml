  # Use `travis_wait` when a long running command or compile step regularly takes longer than 10 minutes without producing any output.
  # It writes a short line to the build log every minute for 20 minutes, extending the amount of time your command has to finish.
  # Prefix `travis_wait` with a greater number to extend the wait time.
