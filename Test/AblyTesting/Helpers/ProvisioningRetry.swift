/// Intended for test-setup provisioning calls (sandbox app creation, fixture ingestion, tooling
/// downloads) where a single stalled request would otherwise fail every test sharing the result.
/// Callers are responsible for retry safety — e.g. the non-idempotent sandbox `POST /apps` is safe
/// because an orphaned app from a timed-out create is auto-deleted after a few minutes of no use.
