/// The unit tier's state waits live on `UTSTestCase` (`awaitConnectionState` / `awaitChannelState` /
/// `poll`) — they poll synchronously, which is fine when a frozen `MockTimeProvider` settles the SDK
/// in microseconds. The integration tier waits on *real* network and proxy state, where blocking the
/// test thread for seconds is wasteful, so it uses the async helpers below (the UTS specs'
/// anti-flake rule: no fixed blind waits — poll on observable state, with a short interval
/// between checks).

/// The integration tier's `poll_until` (the spec's `RETURN result IF … ELSE null` contract, the
/// same loop shape as ably-java's `Utils.pollUntil`): polls `condition` every `interval` seconds
/// until it yields a value and returns that settled value, or records a test failure once
/// `timeout` (wall-clock seconds) elapses. Callers assert on the returned page rather than
/// refetching — a refetch can hit a less-replicated frontend and return fewer items than the poll
/// just observed, reintroducing the eventual-consistency race the poll just absorbed.
///
/// `condition` is `rethrows`: if it throws, the poll aborts immediately and the error propagates
/// to the caller (failing the test) — no timeout `Issue` is recorded. This matches the spec's
/// plain `poll_until`: a thrown error is a genuine failure, whereas a not-ready state is
/// signalled by returning nil (e.g. an under-replicated item count), not by throwing.
