// helpers perform the read against the expected type, returning `nil` when the path doesn't resolve
// or resolves to a different type — which is also how the spec's `value() == null` (the tombstoned /
// absent case, RTLM5d2h) is asserted. A thrown RTO25 precondition error also reads as `nil` here;
// these suites only read on ATTACHED channels, where that error cannot arise.
