/// UTS suites are Swift Testing suites that subclass this (`@Suite(.serialized) final class FooTests: UTSTestCase`).
/// Swift Testing creates a fresh instance per `@Test`, so each test gets its own clients/mocks and
/// `deinit` tears them down.
///
/// Provides the cocoa mappings of the UTS harness primitives:
/// - `installMock(_:)` — the spec's `install_mock`: registers the `MockWebSocketProvider` / `MockHTTPClient`
///   so the next client built by `makeRealtime()` / `makeRest()` picks it up. The mock is never
///   passed to the client constructor (a mistake per `uts/docs/writing-test-specs.md`).
/// - `awaitConnectionState` / `awaitChannelState` — the spec's `AWAIT_STATE`: proceed immediately
///   if the condition already holds, otherwise poll until it does or the timeout expires.
/// - `advanceTime(byMilliseconds:)` — fake-timer advancement (`ADVANCE_TIME`).
/// - protocol-message builders, and cleanup of clients and scheduled timers.
