/**
 A `DataGatherer` instance initiates a user-specified data-gathering activity, and provides a method for waiting until the activity submits some data.

 The `DataGatherer` instance only cares about the _first_ data that is submitted to it, and will ignore any subsequently-submitted data. When the gathered data has value semantics, this can simplify the implementation of tests, since they do not need to be so careful about making sure to stop their data-gathering process at the right time.
