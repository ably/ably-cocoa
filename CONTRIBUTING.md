## Contributing

In this repository the `main` branch contains the latest development version of the Ably SDK. All development (bug fixing, feature implementation, etc.) is done against the `main` branch, which you should branch from whenever you'd like to make modifications. Here's the steps to follow when contributing to this repository.

 - Fork it
 - Install carthage: `brew install carthage`
 - Setup or update your machine by running `make update`
 - Create your feature branch from `main` (`git checkout main && git checkout -b my-new-feature-branch`)
 - Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
 - Ensure you have added suitable tests and the test suite is passing
 - Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature-branch`)
 - Create a new Pull Request

Releases of the Ably SDK built by the sources in this repository are tagged with their [semantic version](http://semver.org/) numbers.

### Development Flow

When you first clone the repository then you will need to run `make update` in order to
bring in Git submodules and Carthage dependencies.

Code can then be modified, built and tested by loading [Ably.xcodeproj](Ably.xcodeproj) in your Xcode IDE.

The Xcode project relies upon dependencies resolved by Carthage.
If you make changes to the [Cartfile](Cartfile) then you will need to run `make update_carthage_dependencies`
from the command line and then do a clean rebuild in Xcode.

Changes made to dependencies in the [Cartfile](Cartfile) need to be reflected in
[Ably.podspec](Ably.podspec) and vice-versa.

## Running tests

To run tests use `make test_[iOS|tvOS|macOS]`.

Note: [Fastlane](https://fastlane.tools) should be installed.

## Release Process

For each release, the following needs to be done:

* Create a new branch `release/x.x.x` (where `x.x.x` is the new version number) from the `main` branch
* Run `make bump_[major|minor|patch]` to bump the new version number (creates a Git commit)
* Run [`github_changelog_generator`](https://github.com/github-changelog-generator/github-changelog-generator) to automate the update of the [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md). This may require some manual intervention, both in terms of how the command is run and how the change log file is modified. Your mileage may vary:
    * The command you will need to run will look something like this: `github_changelog_generator -u ably -p ably-cocoa --since-tag 1.2.6 --output delta.md`
    * Using the command above, `--output delta.md` writes changes made after `--since-tag` to a new file
    * The contents of that new file (`delta.md`) then need to be manually inserted at the top of the `CHANGELOG.md`, changing the "Unreleased" heading and linking with the current version numbers
    * Also ensure that the "Full Changelog" link points to the new version tag instead of the `HEAD`
    * Commit this change: `git add CHANGELOG.md && git commit -m "Update change log."`
* Push both commits to origin: `git push -u origin release/x.x.x`
* Make a pull request against `main` and await approval of reviewer(s)
* Once approved and/or any additional commits have been added, merge the PR (f you do this from Github's web interface then use the "Rebase and merge" option)
* Steps to perform *before* pushing a release tag up:
    1. Checkout `main` locally, pulling in changes from above using `git checkout main && git pull`
    2. Run `make update` to ensure Carthage dependencies are in sync
    3. Generate the prebuilt framework for Carthage using `make carthage_package` (the output from this, `Ably.framework.zip`, will be attached to the release later on)
    4. Validate that the CocoaPods build should succeed using `pod lib lint`
* If any fixes are needed (e.g. the lint fails with warnings) then either commit them to `main` branch now if they are simple warning fixes or perhaps consider raising a new PR if they are complex or likely to need review.
* Create a tag for this version number using `git tag x.x.x`
* Push the tag using `git push origin x.x.x`
* Release an update for CocoaPods using `pod trunk push Ably.podspec`. Details on this command, as well as instructions for adding other contributors as maintainers, are at [Getting setup with Trunk](https://guides.cocoapods.org/making/getting-setup-with-trunk.html) in the [CocoaPods Guides](https://guides.cocoapods.org/)
* Add to [releases](https://github.com/ably/ably-cocoa/releases)
    * refer to previous releases for release notes format
    * attach the prebuilt framework file generated by Carthage to the release: `Ably.framework.zip`
* Test the integration of the library in a Xcode project using Carthage and CocoaPods using the [installation guide](https://github.com/ably/ably-cocoa#installation-guide)
