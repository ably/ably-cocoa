This app gives you a brief understanding of how Ably's Push Notifications work. 
You will need a real iOS device to test this functionality.

- First, go to https://ably.com/accounts/, create an app and copy API key from API Keys tab of the app's dashboard.
- Go to the `Notifications` tab of the Ably's app dashboard and scroll to the `Push Notifications Setup` section. Press `Configure Push` and follow the instructions there.
- Insert it instead of an empty string in the `key` property's value inside the `AblyHelper` class.
- Make sure you've selected your development team in the `Signing & Capabilities` tab of the Xcode project target settings and all the provisioning profiles created without errors.
- Build and Run the app on your device.
- Hit "Activate" button, then hit "Print Token". You should see "IDENTITY TOKEN: exists" printed in the debug output window.
- Hit "Device Details" to display Ably push device registration info after successful activation.
- Go to the `Notifications` tab of the Ably's app dashboard again and scroll to the `Push Inspector` section. Fill in `Title` and `Body` fields of the push notification. Then insert "basic-apns-example" in the `Client ID` field and press enter. Then hit "Push to client" button. You should now see the notification on the screen of your device.
- Also you can send notifications from the app itself if you tick `Push Admin` capability in your API key settings in the app's dashboard. Just hit "Send Push" button to send a predefined push notification which is also will be displayed on your device's screen right away. You can change this behavior in the `UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate` extension for the `AblyHelper` by editing `completionHandler([.banner, .sound])` line of code.
