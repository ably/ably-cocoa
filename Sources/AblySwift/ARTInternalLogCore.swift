/// `ARTInternalLogCore` is the type underlying `ARTInternalLog`, and defines the logging functionality available to components of the SDK.
///
/// It's responsible for receiving log messages from SDK components, performing additional processing on these messages, and forwarding the result to an object conforming to the `ARTVersion2Log` protocol.
///
/// This protocol exists to give internal SDK components access to a rich and useful logging interface, whilst minimising the complexity (and hence the implementation burden for users of the SDK) of the `ARTVersion2Log` protocol. It also allows us to evolve the logging interface used internally without introducing breaking changes for users of the SDK.
///
/// The initial interface of `ARTInternalLogCore` more or less mirrors that of the `ARTLog` class, for compatibility with existing internal SDK code. However, it will evolve as we gather requirements for the information logged by the SDK â€” see issues #1623 and #1624.
