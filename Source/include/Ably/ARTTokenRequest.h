/**
 * A static factory method to create an `ARTTokenRequest` object from a deserialized `TokenRequest`-like object or a JSON stringified `ARTTokenRequest` object. This method is provided to minimize bugs as a result of differing types by platform for fields such as `timestamp` or `ttl`. For example, in Ruby `ttl` in the `TokenRequest` object is exposed in seconds as that is idiomatic for the language, yet when serialized to JSON using `to_json` it is automatically converted to the Ably standard which is milliseconds. By using the `fromJson` method when constructing a `TokenRequest` object, Ably ensures that all fields are consistently serialized and deserialized across platforms.

 * @param json A deserialized `TokenRequest`-like object or a JSON stringified `TokenRequest` object to create an `ARTTokenRequest`.
 * @param errorPtr A reference to the `NSError` object where an error information will be saved in case of failure.

 * @return An Ably token request object.
