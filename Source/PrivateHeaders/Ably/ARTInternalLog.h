/**
 `ARTInternalLog` is the logging class used internally by the SDK. It provides a thin wrapper over `ARTInternalLogCore`, providing variadic versions of that protocol’s methods.

 - Note: It would be great if we could make `ARTInternalLog` a protocol (with a default implementation) instead of a class, since this would make it easier to test the logging behaviour of the SDK. However, since its interface currently makes heavy use of variadic Objective-C methods, which cannot be represented in Swift, we would be unable to write mocks for this protocol in our Swift test suite. As the `ARTInternalLog` interface evolves we may end up removing these variadic methods, in which case we can reconsider.

 Provides a shared logger to be used by all public class methods meeting the following criteria:

 - they wish to perform logging
 - they do not have access to any more appropriate logger
 - their signature is already locked since they are part of the public API of the library

 Currently, this returns a logger that will not actually output any log messages, but I’ve created https://github.com/ably/ably-cocoa/issues/1652 for us to revisit this.
