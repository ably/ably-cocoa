/**
 When `YES`, the client must not access any of the cross-client shared state related to the local device or push activation state machine. The use case is a multi-client demo app (e.g. one with a client under test alongside a diagnostic client) where all side-effects on this shared state should be performed by a single specific client, so that the corresponding log entries appear in that client's logs.

 Enforcement is layered:

 - Persisted state: an `ARTDeviceStorage` is installed that raises on every read and write. This is the backstop for any code path that attempts to touch storage.

 - In-memory shared state: the `ARTLocalDevice` that `ARTRestInternal` exposes via `device_nosync` lives in a process-wide static and may already be cached by another client, so reading it would not necessarily hit storage. `device_nosync` therefore has an explicit guard that raises when this flag is set.

 - Side effects of unrelated flows (e.g. auth propagating a clientId via `ARTAuth.setLocalDeviceClientId_nosync`) silently no-op rather than raise, since raising would break the unrelated flow.

 Other public APIs deliberately about local device or push need not add their own guards — it's acceptable to throw an exception from these APIs.
