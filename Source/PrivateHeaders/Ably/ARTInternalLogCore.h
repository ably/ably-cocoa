/**
 `ARTInternalLogCore` is the type underlying `ARTInternalLog`, and defines the logging functionality available to components of the SDK.

 It’s responsible for receiving log messages from SDK components, performing additional processing on these messages, and forwarding the result to an object conforming to the `ARTVersion2Log` protocol.

 This protocol exists to give internal SDK components access to a rich and useful logging interface, whilst minimising the complexity (and hence the implementation burden for users of the SDK) of the `ARTVersion2Log` protocol. It also allows us to evolve the logging interface used internally without introducing breaking changes for users of the SDK.

 The initial interface of `ARTInternalLogCore` more or less mirrors that of the `ARTLog` class, for compatibility with existing internal SDK code. However, it will evolve as we gather requirements for the information logged by the SDK — see issues #1623 and #1624.
