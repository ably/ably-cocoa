/**
 `ARTLogAdapter` provides an implementation of `ARTVersion2Log` that writes all log messages to a given instance of `ARTLog`.

 The intention of this class is to allow us to maintain the public API of the SDK, which allows users to provide an `ARTLog` instance, whilst using `ARTVersion2Log` for logging inside the SDK. Upon the next major release of this library, when `ARTVersion2Log` will be renamed `ARTLog` and the current `ARTLog` will be removed, we can remove this class too.

 `ARTLogAdapter` implements this `ARTVersion2Log` protocol requirement by calling the `-log:withMessage:` method on its underlying `ARTLog` instance.

 This implementation will necessarily change (becoming more complex) as we evolve the `ARTVersion2Log` protocol and hence the signature of this method. For example, if we add the ability to attach metadata to a log message, then this implementation will need to choose a way of representing that metadata as a string.

 - Note: `ARTLogAdapter` directly calls the underlying `ARTLog` instanceâ€™s `-log:withLevel:` method. It does not call any of the convenience methods in the "`ARTLog (Shorthand)`" category.
